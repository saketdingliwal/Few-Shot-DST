# Few Shot Dialog State Tracking using Meta-learning

Source code for our "D-REPTILE" paper at EACL 2021: [Saket Dingliwal, Bill Gao, Sanchit Agarwal, Tagyoung Chung, and Dilek Hakkani-tur. "Few Shot Dialogue State Tracking using Meta-learning" EACL (2021)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.06779). If you use the code, please cite the paper:

### Work in Progress
Please stay tuned for the complete codebase and the specifications of the model and the hyper-parameters. 


## Installation

## Pipeline
The code consists of the implementation of D-REPTILE and the baseline (Naive Fine-Tuning) using the base model [STARC](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.05827.pdf). The implementation train and evaluate the categorical and non-categorical slots of each domain seperately. The directory structure is explained below
